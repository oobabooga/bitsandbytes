# Compiling from source

## Windows

cpu: most tests fail, this library requires CUDA to use the special bits.

Ensure you have your environment you want to bring in bitsandbytes. (a bloom setup, textgen-ui, etc) - via conda.
I'd suggest to install MAMBA  and use it, as it's way faster.

IMPORTANT - ensure your environment.yml matches your installed CUDA version in Visual Studio. Keep One VERSION.

1. environment.yml. Replace/tweak as necesarry (remove cuda, change version):
```
name: mycompileenv
channels:
  - pytorch
  - nvidia
  - huggingface
  - conda-forge
  - anaconda
    
dependencies:
  - python=3.10.9
  - pytorch-cuda=11.7 
  - pytorch
  - torchvision
  - torchaudio 
  - transformers
  - cudatoolkit=11.7
  - jupyter
  - notebook
  - pytest
  - einops
  - scipy
```

2. Then open POWERSHELL
```
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba env create
mamba env activate mycompileenv
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1" -List -Arch amd64
```
At this point - select your visual studio installation - aka hit 1

3. you can now build with Conda 11.6 and 11.7 by & `./buildall.ps1` Feel free to customize the script as per your needs.


### Manual configuration with cmake-gui

3. Go into your bitsandbytes folder and run `cmake-gui -S . -B ./build` 
5. Hit Configure
6. Set `cuda=11.7`, nothing, or other version in the `Optional toolset to use` when selecting the generator to . You can leave it blank. If you don't see the generate, delete the `build` folder and run cmake-gui again with the above command line.

The `Optional toolset to use` will determine the dll name. You need to have that CUDA toolkit and VS integration installed using the NVIDIA installer
7. You should see in the log some info:
```
CONFIGURE_LOG
Configuring using Cuda Compiler 11.7.64; Visual Studio Integration: 11.7

CONFIGURE_LOG CUDA Targeting feature level 11.x, with architectures 52
CONFIGURE_LOG Shared library name being used: libbitsandbytes_cuda117
```
7. Set `CUDA_TARGET_ARCH_FEATURE_LEVEL` to you desired feature level. Supported: 10.x, 11.0, 11.x, 12.x
8. `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` is overwritten by `CUDA_TARGET_ARCH_FEATURE_LEVEL` for now
9. Select other options. Hit Generate.
10. Open Visual Studio and select Release as configuration. Build Solution
11. Everything should be copied in the right place
12. run tests `python -m pytest`. You may need to use `mamba` to install other modules
13. build wheel `mamba install build` and then `python -m build --wheel`
14. install wheel  `pip install .\dist\*.whl`


## Linux
Basic steps.
1. `CUDA_VERSION=XXX make [target]` where `[target]` is among `cuda92, cuda10x, cuda110, cuda11x, cuda12x, cpuonly`
2. `python setup.py install`

To run these steps you will need to have the nvcc compiler installed that comes with a CUDA installation. If you use anaconda (recommended) then you can figure out which version of CUDA you are using with PyTorch via the command `conda list | grep cudatoolkit`. Then you can install the nvcc compiler by downloading and installing the same CUDA version from the [CUDA toolkit archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).

You can install CUDA locally without sudo by following the following steps:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/main/install_cuda.sh
# Syntax cuda_install CUDA_VERSION INSTALL_PREFIX EXPORT_TO_BASH
#   CUDA_VERSION in {110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 121}
#   EXPORT_TO_BASH in {0, 1} with 0=False and 1=True 

# For example, the following installs CUDA 11.7 to ~/local/cuda-11.7 and exports the path to your .bashrc
bash install_cuda.sh 117 ~/local 1 
```

By default, the Makefile will look at your `CUDA_HOME` environmental variable to find your CUDA version for compiling the library. If this path is not set it is inferred from the path of your `nvcc` compiler.

Either `nvcc` needs to be in path for the `CUDA_HOME` variable needs to be set to the CUDA directory root (e.g. `/usr/local/cuda`) in order for compilation to succeed

If you type `nvcc` and it cannot be found, you might need to add to your path or set the CUDA_HOME variable. You can run `python -m bitsandbytes` to find the path to CUDA. For example if `python -m bitsandbytes` shows you the following:
```
++++++++++++++++++ /usr/local CUDA PATHS +++++++++++++++++++
/usr/local/cuda-11.7/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcudart.so
```
You can set `CUDA_HOME` to `/usr/local/cuda-11.7`. For example, you might be able to compile like this.

``CUDA_HOME=~/local/cuda-11.7 CUDA_VERSION=117 make cuda11x``


If you have problems compiling the library with these instructions from source, please open an issue.

## Compilation with Kepler

Since 0.39.1 bitsandbytes installed via pip no longer provides Kepler binaries and these need to be compiled from source. Follow the steps above and instead of `cuda11x_nomatmul` etc use `cuda11x_nomatmul_kepler`
